# The AGI Progression Timeline

## 1950

### Conceptual Inception of Artificial Intelligence

Alan Turing publishes "Computing Machinery and Intelligence," proposing the Turing Test as a criterion of intelligence.

- **Reflection:** Turing's paper represents a monumental leap towards AGI, akin to the first steps of a marathon. The starting gun has been fired, setting us on a path that leads to "midnight."

## 1956

### Birth of AI as a Field of Study

The Dartmouth Conference takes place, coining the term "Artificial Intelligence."

- **Reflection:** The coining of the term "Artificial Intelligence" is a foundational moment that cements AI's place in academic and research communities, accelerating our journey towards "midnight."

## 1966

### Early Natural Language Processing

ELIZA, an early natural language processing computer program, is created.

- **Reflection:** ELIZA's ability to mimic human conversation, however primitive, marks a small but significant tick towards "midnight," showcasing the potential for machines to interact with us on our terms.

## 1974

### The First AI Winter

Pessimism about AI's lofty goals leads to a reduction in funding and interest.
